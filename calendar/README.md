# Getting Started with Create React App
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

In this project, I have created a calendar app using Type script  and React.
The app uses React hooks to manage state and effect.

The app is responsive and displays
- The current month and year
- The days of the week
- The days of the month
- The current day is highlighted
- The user can navigate to the previous and next months

For styling, I have used styled-components and tailWind CSS.

The app is deployed on Netlify and can be accessed [here](https://calendar-app-2021.netlify.app/)
